[Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/CodeAcademy/computerclass.rb)\r\n* Create a small program that will read a user's input and correct his or her capitalization. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/CodeAcademy/formFormatter.rb)\r\n* Counts up the number of occurrences of each word in your string. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/CodeAcademy/histogram.rb)\r\n* This program demonstrate mixin concept in which we use module in our class at instance level. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/CodeAcademy/mixin.rb)\r\n* Create a movie hash and take user input to add, update, display or delete any movie from hash.

[Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/CodeAcademy/prime.rb)\r\n* Write a simple program to change a user's input with the secret word replaced with 'REDACTED'. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/CodeAcademy/redacted.rb)\r\n* In this project, we'll combine control flow with a few new Ruby string methods to Daffy Duckify a user's string, replacing each \"s\" with \"th\". [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/CodeAcademy/replaceSwithTH.rb)\r\n* Two way sort. if second parameter is true then alphabetize sort the array in descending order otherwise in ascending order.

Ruby Primer\r\n* 9 is a Kaprekar number since \r\n9 ^ 2 = 81 and 8 + 1 = 9\r\n297 is also Kaprekar number since \r\n297 ^ 2 = 88209 and 88 + 209 = 297.\r\nIn short, for a Kaprekar number k with n-digits, if you square it and add the right n digits to the left n or n-1 digits, the resultant sum is k. \r\nFind if a given number is a Kaprekar number.\r\n[Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/RubyPrimer/Kaprekar.rb)\r\n* Perimeter module for rectangle and square. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/RubyPrimer/PerimeterModule.rb)\r\n* Given an array, return true if all the elements are Fixnums. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/RubyPrimer/allFixnum.rb)\r\n* Problem Statement\r\nFor 2 Colors in RGB: \r\n(R1, G1, B1) and (R2, G2, B2),\r\nBrightness index is: \r\n( 299*R1 + 587*G1 + 114*B1) / 1000 \r\nBrightness difference is: \r\nAbsolute difference in brighness indices \r\nHue difference is: \r\n|R1 - R2| + |G1 - G2| + |B1 - B2|\r\nwhere |x| is the absolute value of x\r\nIf Brightness difference is more than 125 and the Hue difference is more than 500 then the colors have sufficient contrast\r\nFind out if the given color combos have sufficient contrast and get all the tests passing. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/RubyPrimer/colorContrast.rb)\r\n* You are given some code in the form of lambdas. Measure and return the time taken to execute that code. You may use Time.now to get the current time. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/RubyPrimer/executionTime.rb)\r\n* Find the frequency of a string in a sentence. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/RubyPrimer/frequency.rb)\r\n* Find the length of strings in an array. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/RubyPrimer/lenOfStrings.rb)\r\n* Given a sentence, return true if the sentence is a palindrome. You are supposed to write a method palindrome? to accomplish this task. Note: Ignore whitespace and cases of characters. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/RubyPrimer/palindrome.rb)\r\n* Create a method 'random_select' which, when given an array of elements (array) and a number (n), returns n randomly selected elements from that array. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/RubyPrimer/sampleArray.rb)\r\n* Given a 3 or 4 digit number with distinct digits, return a sorted array of all the unique numbers that can be formed with those digits.\r\nExample: \r\nGiven: 123 \r\nReturn: [123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321]. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/RubyPrimer/shuffle.rb)\r\n* Sort the words in a given sentence by length. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/RubyPrimer/sortByLength.rb)\r\n* Given a custom class MyArray, \r\nwrite a 'sum' method that takes a block parameter.\r\nExample: \r\nmy_array = MyArray.new([1, 2, 3]) \r\nmy_array.sum gives 6 \r\nmy_array.sum(10) gives 16 \r\nmy_array.sum(0) {|n| n ** 2 } gives 14\r\n[Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/RubyPrimer/sum.rb)\r\n* Compute the sum of cubes for a given range a through b. [Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Ruby-Portfolio/blob/master/RubyPrimer/sumOfCubes.rb)\r\n* Given an Array, return the elements that are present exactly once in the array.
